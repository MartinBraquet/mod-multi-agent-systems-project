# Project: Modelling of Multi-Agent Systems

Run `LQFeedbackFunction(A, B1, B2, Q1, Q2, R1, R2, x1, horizon)` to obtain the feedback LQ solution of a two-agent system.

Create environment: `python3 -m venv env`

Activate environment: `source env/bin/activate`

Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Additionally (for IBR only), the MOSEK package requires a license which can be installed at https://www.mosek.com/products/academic-licenses/.


Then run 'src/plotIBR.py' to plot the results
